    "*** Java is a strict OOP language with strict requirements ***\n",

    "- All code lives inside a class*, even helper functions + global constraints, etc.\n",

    "*** Java is statically typed ***\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables, parameters and methods must have a declared type.\n",
    "That type can never change.\n",
    "Expressions also have a type e.g 'large(5, 10) + 3' has type int.\n",
    "The compiler checks that all the types in your pgram are compatible before the program ever runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- e.g String x = larger(5, 10) + 3 will fail to compile.\n",

    "*** Pros vs Cons of Static Typing ***\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Catches certain types of errors, making it easier on the programmer to debug their code.\n",
    "- Type errors can (almost) never occur on end user's computer.\n",
    "- Make it easier to read and reason about code.\n",
    "- Code can run more efficiently, e.g no need to do expensive runtime type checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Code becomes more verbose (alot more lines to read compared especially coming from Python)\n",
    "- Code is less general, e.g had to have two different larger functions earlier."
